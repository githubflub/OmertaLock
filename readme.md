How to set up: 

I made this in Eclipse Juno, so just clone this into any Eclipse workspace of your choice. Then just import the project using the following steps. 

1. Open Eclipse
2. Right click on empty space in Package Explorer
3. Choose Import...
4. Expand General
5. Select Existing Projects into Workspace
6. Click Next > 
7. The Select root directory radio button should be selected. 
8. Click Browse...
9. Navigate to and select the workspace folder you are using.
10. Click OK
11. OmertaLock should appear in Projects: box. Select it. 
12. Click Finish. 
13. That's it!


How to run: 

1. Select OmertaLock in Package Explorer
2. Press CTRL+F11 or Run > Run or click the round green button with the white play symbol in it. 
3. Run as Java Application if it asks. 
4. That's it!
